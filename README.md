# finding-anagram
This is  the solution to the finding-anagram task from zuri-training 
the link to the github repo https://olokoburnfire.github.io/finding-anagram/
I had to go through some blog post in order to understand the concep of this little game.
oh and i realised how important scribbling/ writting things down is!!
also in order to work fast and well, i learnt it better to create an algorithm flowchat before the start of any projects so as to know what step to take while coding. 


don't mind my rant, i just dont know what to write here
